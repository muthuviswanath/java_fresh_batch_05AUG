class Chair {
/*
 * By default every class comes with an automatic constructor called default constructor
 * The compiler provides the default constructor
 * The access specifier of the default constructor is same as its class
 * The signature of the default constructor is nothing.
 * 
 * The name of the constructor and the name of the class must be the same.
 * The constructor cannot return any value and hence it does not have a return type
 * A constructor cannot be static or final or abstract
 * The constructor's access specifier can be higher than the class or lower than the class
 * A constructor cannot be overridden using inheritance
 * When a user creates a constructor, the default constructor will not be provided
 * User can define a non-parameterized constructor or a parameterized constructor.
 * Constructors can be overloaded.
 * It is possible to call one constructor from another constructor of the same class or of a super class
 * The first line of a constructor is super() calling statement.
 * This can be replaced by this() calling statement if the constructors are involved in local chaining.
 * It is not possible to have cyclic chaining.
 * A constructor cannot call itself
 * Purpose of a constructor:
 * 		1. To initialize the instance variables at the time of object creation
 * 		2. To assist in creating objects
 * */
